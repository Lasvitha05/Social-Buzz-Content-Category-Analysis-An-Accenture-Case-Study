# Social-Buzz-Content-Category-Analysis-An-Accenture-Case-Study

## Project Overview
Social Buzz is a fast-growing social media platform with 500M+ monthly active users and 100,000+ daily content uploads. As the company prepares for an IPO within the next year, it faces critical challenges in big data management, engagement analysis, and content optimization.

### This project provides a comprehensive data-driven approach to:

- Audit Social Buzz’s big data infrastructure to handle large-scale content.
- Analyze content engagement trends to identify the most interactive categories.
- Develop insights and visualization tools to optimize user interaction.
- Provide a strategic roadmap for IPO preparation with data-driven best practices.

## Problem Statement
Despite its rapid growth, Social Buzz struggles with:
- Managing massive unstructured data from diverse content uploads.
- Identifying top-performing content categories to enhance user engagement.
- Understanding sentiment & reaction patterns to optimize content strategy.
- Scaling data infrastructure to support long-term growth and IPO readiness.
The project focuses on analyzing user interactions across 16 content categories to determine which categories drive the most engagement and how Social Buzz can leverage these insights.

## Data Analytics Process
The project follows a structured 5-step data analytics workflow to ensure a comprehensive and accurate analysis:
### Step 1: Data Extraction
The dataset was sourced from Social Buzz’s content and engagement logs from 2020-2021.
#### Included features:
- Post ID – Unique identifier for each post.
- Category – Content classification (e.g., Travel, Science, Cooking, etc.).
- Timestamp – Date and time of post creation.
- Reaction Type – Types of reactions (e.g., Heart, Like, Wow, Angry, etc.).
- Reaction Count – Number of each reaction type per post.
### Step 2: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Handled missing values by removing incomplete records.
- Standardized category labels to avoid duplication issues.
- Normalized timestamps for accurate time-series analysis.
- Filtered data to relevant engagement metrics (posts with at least 10 reactions).
### Step 3: Data Processing & Feature Engineering
- Reaction Score Calculation:
- Weighted reaction scores were assigned to quantify engagement.
- Example: Heart = 2 points, Like = 1 point, Wow = 1.5 points, Angry = -1 point (to capture sentiment influence).
- Monthly Aggregation: Summarized reactions & posts per month for trend analysis.
- Sentiment Analysis: Categorized posts into positive, neutral, and negative sentiment using reaction patterns.
### Step 4: Data Analysis Techniques
- 1️⃣ Descriptive Analytics – Examined the number of posts, engagement trends, and reaction counts across content categories.

- 2️⃣ Correlation Analysis – Assessed the relationship between posting frequency and engagement.

- 3️⃣ Sentiment Analysis – Evaluated how different categories perform based on positive vs. negative reactions.

- 4️⃣ Time-Series Analysis – Tracked engagement trends over months to detect seasonal patterns.

### Step 5: Data Visualization
- 📊 Bar Charts – Monthly posting trends to identify peak engagement periods.
- 📈 Heatmaps – Reaction distributions across categories for sentiment analysis.
- 📌 Stacked Bar Charts – Comparing positive & negative reactions per category.
- 📍 Word Clouds – Highlighting the most engaging keywords in high-performing categories.
